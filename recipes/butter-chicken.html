    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite Indian dinners is this crockpot butter chicken. This dish was created by a friend for my family, and when we had it, we fell in love! I don't think I've ever had a better butter chicken. I enjoy putting it in the slow cooker in the morning and coming home to the aroma of warm Indian spices... Serve with warm naan bread and basmati rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegatable oil</li>
            <li>4 large skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bitsized pieces</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon curry paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tandori masala</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>15 cardamom pods</li>
            <li>1 can coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 cup low-fat plain yoghurt</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and vegetable oil. Combine the chicken, onion, and garlic in a mixing bowl. 
                Cook and stir for 10 minutes, or until the onion has softened and turned translucent. Add tomato paste, curry paste, curry powder, 
                tandoori masala, and garam masala and stir until no tomato paste lumps remain.</li>
            <li>Fill a slow cooker halfway with the mixture; whisk in the cardamom pods, coconut milk, and yogurt. Season with salt and pepper.</li> 
            <li>Cook for 4–6 hours on high (or 6–8 hours on low) until chicken is cooked and sauce has reduced to desired consistency. 
                Before serving, remove and discard the cardamom pods.</li>   

        </ol>
