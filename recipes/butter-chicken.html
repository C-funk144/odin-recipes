    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite Indian dinners is this crockpot butter chicken. This dish was created by a friend for my family, and when we had it, we fellÂ in love! I don't think I've ever had a better butter chicken. I enjoy putting it in the slow cooker in the morning and coming home to the aroma of warm Indian spices... Serve with warm naan bread and basmati rice.</p>
